# minishell

The objective of this project is to create a simple shell. My own little bash or zsh.
I will learn a lot about processes and file descriptors.

## Scope of vars to pipes:
![tokens](./tokens.png)</br></br>

## File descriptors in multiple processes
![pipes](./fd_and_pipes.png)</br></br>
